## My Projects

## [Project 1: Recommendation System for Restaurants](https://github.com/Thib-Matt/Recommendation_System_Zurich_Restaurants.git)

In a world where the large commercial offer is overwhelming us, online reviews have a significant impact on customers' decision.

The project consisted in creating a tool that proposes a personalized list of restaurants based on users profiles.
- Scraped around 1800 restaurants and 1900 reviewers' profiles from TripAdvisor using Python and Selenium
- Engineered features from restaurants' description to extract usable information (type of cuisine, price range and popularity)
- Built profiles' clusters based on an unspervised learning algorithm
- Productionized the solution: created a web-app connected to a Flask API

## [Project 2: COVID-19 Relevant Articles Finder](https://github.com/Thib-Matt/Recommendation_System_Zurich_Restaurants.git)

To answer the call to action to leverage our expertise as Data Scientists and developers in the fight against COVID-19, we created a smart search engine that suggests relevant academic articles related to coronavirus based on user's specific request. 

The project consisted in:
- cleaning and preprocessing the articles
- building an unspervised learning algorithm to identify undiscovered topics in the set of articles.
- productionizing the solution by developing a Flask API and a Web-interface
- Deployment/DevOps: containerizing the whole solution with Docker

This could help the medical community by generating new insights among over 400k academic articles.
