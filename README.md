## [Project 1: Recommendation System for Restaurants](https://github.com/Thib-Matt/Recommendation_System_Zurich_Restaurants.git)

In a world where the large commercial offer is overwhelming us, online reviews have a significant impact on customers' decision.

The project consisted in creating a tool that proposes a personalized list of restaurants based on users profiles.
- Scraped around 1800 restaurants and 1900 reviewers' profiles from TripAdvisor using Python and Selenium
- Engineered features from restaurants' description to extract usable information (type of cuisine, price range and popularity)
- Built profiles' clusters based on an unspervised learning algorithm (K-means)
- Productionized the solution: created a web-app connected to a Flask API
